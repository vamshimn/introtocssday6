        François "Faf" du Plessis (/ˈduːplɛsi/ DOO-pless-ee; born 13 July 1984) is a South African professional cricketer and former captain of the South Africa national cricket team. He is considered one of the greatest fielders of all time and among the best all-format batsmen of his era.[1][2][3][4] He is also regarded as one of the most tactically astute and successful captains in all formats of modern cricket.[5][6] In 2015, du Plessis became the first South African to score centuries in all forms of the game. He was named as the South African Cricketer of the Year in 2019.[7]
